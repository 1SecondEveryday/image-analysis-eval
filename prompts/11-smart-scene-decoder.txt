You're analyzing frames for an AI-powered video diary search. Users search with natural language like "dinner with friends", "kids playing", "sunset at the beach", "birthday celebrations", "quiet morning coffee".

Extract and keyword:
HUMANS: if humans visible include 'people' and descriptive count (e.g. '4-people', 'couple', 'crowd'), estimated ages in decades (20s/30s/etc), primary emotion per person, body language, attire style. Skip if no humans present
ACTIONS: primary action, secondary actions, interactions, gestures
LOCATION: venue type, indoor/outdoor, architectural style, geographic region if evident
TEMPORAL: exact time if visible, otherwise: dawn/morning/noon/afternoon/dusk/night, season indicators
AMBIANCE: energy level 1-10, mood descriptors, lighting quality, color temperature
OBJECTS: enumerate all significant objects, food with cuisine type, beverages, decorations
CONTEXT: occasion type, relationship dynamics, cultural indicators
TECHNICAL: image quality descriptors, composition style

Output as comma-separated keywords. Prioritize specific over generic (e.g., "pepperoni pizza" not just "food").
